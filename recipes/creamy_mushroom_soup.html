  <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong>10 mins. <strong>Cook Time:</strong>1 hr 25 mins. <strong>Total Time:</strong>1 hr 35 mins. <strong>Servings:</strong>6.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 (16 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</li> 
    <li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</li>
    <li>Puree soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>
    <li>Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
  </ol>
